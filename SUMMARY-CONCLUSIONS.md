*5 years of the closing price over the s&p index*
### Obversations
**general upward trend** : the prices has was more than doubled in 5 years, and even major crash like the 2020 covid one has recovered. Other minor crashs almost every year recovers as well. We can even obverse a significant growth after 2023, maybe linked with the AI raise. 

### Conclusions 
The market seems to reward patient, long-term investors who dont panic sell after a short term crash. Each one of them was a buying oportunity, but we have to stay viligent to the overevaluation risks. 

## 2. Returns in %

### Obversations
**high fluctuations** of 5-10% early 2020, probably due to the covid crisis. The market stabilizes as the year progresses. The negative returns shows the panic selling days, the investors not previsionning that the very same stocks would double worth in the upcoming years. 

### Conclusions 
Again, short term trading was risky, with possible 10% losses in a single day, but long term strategies tend to in average make a decent positive gain. Market overall normalized over time, but volatiliy persisted (see upcoming graph).


## 3. 30 days volatility

*The graph shows the rolling 30 days std deviation of daily returns.*

### Obversations
**Sharp volatility spike** in 2020, during the covid crash. Through 2021 volatiliy was still elavted, maybe due to speculations about recovery. Periodic spikes in 2022-2023, after 2023 fluctuations decrease, perhaps geopolitical tensions. 


### Conclusions 
A third time: market shocks are temporary. Historical data shows that markets are resilient and eventually stabilize over time. While significant day to day volatility seem overwhelming, its best to avoid panic selling and focus on long term growth.

#General conclusions
Markets show high volatility during crisis, and stabilizes over time. So long term startegies are to prioritize. Analyzing historical datas about volatility and returns can help improve investments decisions.
